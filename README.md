# Things I performed in this assignment 
1)created bookController.js
2)created bookModel.js
3)created router handler

I had Implemented "MEN"
# MEN  : MONGOOSE_EXPRESS_NODEJS

Very first thing is i imported mongoose module inside BookController.js
and wrote all functions like createBook,getBooks,getParticularBooks and so on ....
# syntax to export | module.exports.createBK=CreateBK |
And later I exported this all function by module.exports.createBK=CreateBK  

# Mongoose Query
# find/findOne/findByID/findOneAndUpdate/select/sort/limit/skip

# Mongoose filter 
# $in $or $eq $gt $gte $lte $gt $lt $nin 

# Mistakes i did 
1) when i took input from body ,in find() i put the input aggreating it find({input}) We should put find(input)
2) always put one more address for eg /getBook/search/
